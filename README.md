# Agile Business Management Manifesto

- [Português - Brasil](https://github.com/agilebusinessmanagement/manifesto/blob/master/README.pt_br.md)

We are uncovering new ways to manage companies by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools

**Sustainable and Functional Companies** over documentation, hierarchy and bureaucracy

**Collaboration with customers and their teams** over competitive contract negotiation

**Adaptation and rapid response to change** over following an immutable plan

While there is value in the items on the right, we value items on the left more.

*Inspired by the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)*

# Agile Business Management Guidelines

> "The limits of my language means the limits of my world." ─Ludwig Wittgenstein

1. The basic principle of any entity, institution or company is to help people in an incremental, sustainable and autonomous way; at the same time that it remains alive and running.

2. There are only 4 classes of work: General Management, Financial, Commercial and Productive. Any other area is a specialization of one or more of these 4 classes.

3. The division of labor and the scope of each area must be clearly defined, finite and complementary to the other areas. 

4. Each area also has its own profile, interests and mindset; the accumulation of functions can be dealt with by learning to act in different roles within these different profiles, mindsets, needs and wants.

5. The Financial wants to plan, organize, direct and control everything based on numbers, facts, events, time flows, human resources, capital and materials.

6. The Commercial Comercial wants the best for all customers. Its life consists of interactions, relationships and problem solving through the ability to observe, integrate, create solutions and negotiate.

7. The Productive always wants the best solution for customers' problems. Although it does not have direct customer relationships, it values ​​its ability and technical quality along with its creativity to provide the best solutions for customers.

8. The General Management supports in the negotiations and facilitations between those areas, aiding agreements to happen in an exempt form and focused in problem solving; while maintaining the focus and motivation of the team on the primary purpose of the entity by viewing and verifying its periodic results.

9. Collaboration, coexistence and interaction of motivated people are prerequisites for all forms of work.

10. Competition is only healthy within an innovative collaborative scope. Other than that, it's just a waste of energy.

11. There is no such thing as a perfect job: there is what is done and what is not.

12. Each week and every month, we will try to define and carry out only what is not done yet and is essential for the maintenance of the entity and the purpose of it.

13. Hierarchy, in general, creates more obstacles than it helps. Likewise, not all processes are really effective or apply in every case.

14. Work must be done through mutual agreement between individuals - peer-to-peer and/or in person - with full trust and confidence that each one will deliver the results and feedbacks initially agreed.

15. Just talk about what you're sure of, do not be afraid to assume you do not know and do not speculate. This ensures a greater notion of reality and supports decision making with greater maturity.

16. Communication, Information and Culture must always be peer-to-peer and horizontal.

17. Working together means working together for a common goal in an efficient and effective manner.

18. Objectives that are not clear are not objectives: every objective must be defined in a single sentence. Not a paragraph. Not a document. A Phrase.

19. Goal is the union between objective, deadline and responsible.

20. Any objective that has not turned into a goal is not important.

21. If it's not fun, it's not worth it; if it does not help someone else, either.
